## A framework for aeroponic farming devices

This project aims to set out an architecture for aeroponics that is easy to set up, durable, and semi portable. The project it is currently early in development, and the current features are limited to:
* Code for a duty & frequency controlled solenoid for spray release
* Code for pressure monitoring & pressure control (target with threshold)
* LED intensity
* Images from within the device to monitor plant health

Code for the management platform can be viewed here https://github.com/voidtype/plant-matrix

## Look out for
* A roadmap
